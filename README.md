# PacMen

## What is about

> This app creates a Pacman every time you click on the create pacman button, and one you have all the pacmen you need the pacmen will move around the screen once you click on the Start Button
> 

## How to see it in action?

> You have two options:

  * By clicking on this [link](https://leonsuaren.github.io/PacMen/), you will be redirected to the URL provided by Github.
  * Clon the Repo with this command ' *git clone https://github.com/leonsuaren/PacMen.git* ', once you have it in your computer just drag and drop the index.html in your browser or double click in the index.html and your browser will open it.

  ## Future improvements:

  * Right now this APP is running with vanilla javascript, CSS, and HTML, but I would like to refactore it and create a React APP.
